![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is the first Front End mentor challenge I did,

The solution was made with **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Screenshoots ðŸ¤¨ðŸ“·

Here are screenshots of the results for the widths 1440px for desktop and 375px for mobile respectively.
